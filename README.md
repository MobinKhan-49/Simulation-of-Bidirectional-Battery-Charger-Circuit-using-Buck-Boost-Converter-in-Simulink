This project presents a bi-directional battery charger circuit
controlled by a PI controller. The DC to DC converters play a key role in solar power plants, battery charging stations, and electrical vehicles. This bi-directional DC to DC converter allows for both charging and discharging of batteries. It functions as a boost converter during discharging and as a buck converter when charging. The bi-directional converter is controlled by a closed-loop PI controller. The simulation results of this paper are verified using Simulink software during both charging and discharging modes, and the results reached the reference values.
